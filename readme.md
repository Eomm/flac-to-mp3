## Disclaimer

This project is a fork of [adrianblynch/flac-to-mp3](https://github.com/adrianblynch/flac-to-mp3) original project.
The name of the variable `FlacConverter` in the usage section, reflect this origins until a complete wrapping of the ffmpeg will be completed.

This is an ultra-wide learning project, doesn't aim to be a [complete-ready-to-use-ffmpeg-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluent-ffmpeg), but this want to give to contributors the opportunity to master:
+ To analyze and implement software components
+ Node's feature (like child process, stream and promise)
+ Building with CI
+ Testing and Coverage
+ Useful tools (`npm`, `vs code`)
+ Managing enviroments
+ and much more..


## Installation

**NPM package**

```
npm install ffmpeg-wrapper
```

This module need that [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) is installed on the local machine.


**Docker image**

```
docker pull eomm/ffmpeg-wrapper:1.0.0
```


### Usage

```
const FlacConverter = require('ffmpeg-wrapper')
const converter = new FlacConverter();

converter.convertFile('path/to/file.flac')
      .then((file) => {
        // The file is converted at path "file"
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        // An error occured
      });

converter.convertDirectory('path-with-flac/')
      .then((files) => {
        // All files are converted
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        // An error occured (some files could be converted)
      });

```

With docker you can run simply a one-convert-action that convert a directory and then remove the container:

```
docker container run -v "/c/Users/user/convertDirectory/:/var/convert/" --rm eomm/ffmpeg-wrapper
```
